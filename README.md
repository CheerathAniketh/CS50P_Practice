#  CS50P Journey

Hey there!  
This repo documents my progress through **Harvard’s CS50’s Introduction to Programming with Python**.  
I’m building my Python fundamentals, problem-solving mindset, and a few fun automations along the way.

## 📓 What You’ll Find
- My **own implementations** of CS50P problems (no official solutions here 🚫).  
- **Extra mini-projects** and experiments I tried to reinforce concepts.  
- **Notes & learnings** from each week — short and honest reflections.

---

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- Language: **Python 3**
- Tools: **VS Code**, **GitHub**, **CS50 IDE**
- Version Control: **Git**

##  Final Thoughts
This repo is my growth log , from writing my first `print("Hello, world!")`  
to building stuff that actually *does something*.  
If you’re learning Python too, feel free to peek around and get ideas 👀
